# READ-IT

## What is READ-IT?

It is a full stack MERN application designed and developed by JLMars Developers that 
provides a collaborative content mash-up platform for readers and writers. 
The application allows the users to create short stories, poems, 
and to collaborate with other users to create content, and 
view created content of other users. 


## How to run the application

Our application is currently locally host. To run it on your device, you must first clone the repository
to your preferred IDE. We recommend VS Code.
Once you have opened the folder on VS Code, open a new terminal and split the terminal.
Use the command `cd client` on the first terminal and #`cd server` on the second terminal. Run the 
command `npm i` on both terminals.

Once it has finished installing missing dependencies, you use the command `npm start` on both 
terminals (first server side and then client side) to start the application.
**Note that you need to have nodejs installed and mongoDB setup for the application to run.**
